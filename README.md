# Nix Config

My personal nix configuration. It's based on a standalone home manager config, so that I don't need sudo for switching.
The config contains everything I use with the major exception being neovim, which is located in a
[separate repo](http://github.com/viddrobnic/init.lua) and still uses lua.
